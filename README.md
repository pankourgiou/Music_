# Music_
I listen much music so a black metal style album I can listen is from Yoth Iria...the vocals thing is easy to isolate but there are some symbols that are questionable from my social circle(the reverse cross for example)
anyway if we limit the artistic expression I doubt if it is art. 
The second album that is also cool is from the Anciients. I see a three guitars(inspiration) there and I really enjoy this album. I'll post the artworks on Issues folder and it would be nice to support those bands.
There is this idea about the music format for example people can support live performances of bigger bands(which is what happens already in the first place) but with use of the web to try to support the released albums of smaller/kinda underground bands.
It's simple because back at 80's or 90's internet usage was small, you had to read Greek Metal Hammer or Metal Invader then go downtown to Metropolis or Rockcity with a bus buy the album(in it's physical form) and go back. Nowadays I don't even use the bus to go downtown...
